----------------


This project was rebuilt by merging its codebase with a fork of [The R plugin](https://github.com/ktisha/TheRPlugin). So most credits go to go [ktisha](https://github.com/ktisha).
  
This project would not have been possible without the great [bash plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4230?pr=phpStorm) which inspired us a lot when getting started with r4intellij, and from which we borrowed also some code.
